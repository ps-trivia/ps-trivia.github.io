### Procedure

- Users can join the game during signups by typing `/me in` in chat.
- The host shuffles the player order.
- The first player is given three facts, where one is false and the other two are true, or where one is true and the other two are false.
- The player must identify the odd fact out within 15 seconds. If they fail to do so, they are eliminated.
- The host will go through the order until everyone has gone once, then the remaining players will be re-shuffled into a new order and the next round will begin. 
- This continues until two players remain. The remaining players and shuffled, and the hosts alternates between the two until one is eliminated. 
- The last player standing wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Signups are started with `~plmax [desired number of players]`.
- A player can be added manually with `~pladd [user]` and can be eliminated with `~plremove [user]`
- The player order can be shuffled using `~plshuffle`.
- To set a timer, use `~timer ,[seconds]`.
- Holding shift and pressing enter allows multiple lines to be typed at once, allowing for timer to be set immediately after the question is given.
- All remaining players can be seen using `~pl` or `~pllist`.
- Once the minigame is over, `~plclear` is used to clear the player list.
