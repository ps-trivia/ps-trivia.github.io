# Minigames

While Trivia Tracker is fun, sometimes you want something to spice up your Trivia experience. Minigames do exactly that, and while some of them are similar to Trivia Tracker with a twist, others are a totally different way to play! Sometimes minigames are scheduled as part of an event, and sometimes they happen on a whim. If you want to participate in one, ask if there are any planned or check back often!

**How do they work?**  
Generally, one user will host the minigame and it will begin with a period where players must indicate if they wish to participate. The highlight word used for the signup period is 'triviasignups'. Please make sure that you have signed up if you want to play, and be mindful of the current minigame if there is one in progress when you enter the room. (There was another etiquette point I had but I forgot)

**So you want to host a minigame?**  
Auth can host minigames almost anytime, but regular users can host games as well if they [apply to do so ahead of time](/submissions.html)!
