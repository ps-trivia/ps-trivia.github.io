*(Notice how the captains PM the host to select their teammates. Also notice how the captain is the one that chooses which player is eliminated (although it does not always have to be the one that just played).*

### Procedure

- Users can join the game during signups by typing `/me in` in chat.
- Players are divided into two teams, and a captain is designated on each team.
- At the beginning of every round, the question's category is revealed. Each team's captain will nominate a member to answer the question.
- The host asks a question, and the player who answers the question first survives. The losing team must eliminated a member from their team, as decided by their captain.
- The team captain cannot be eliminated until every other member has also been eliminated.
- This continues until one team runs out of players. The last team wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Signups are started with `~plmax [desired number of players]`.
- Groupchats for each team can be created with `/makegroupchat`.
- A player can be added manually with `~pladd [user]` and can be eliminated with `~plremove [user]`.
- All remaining players can be seen using `~pl` or `~pllist`.
- Categories can be randomly picked and broadcasted with `!pick AE, SH, SG, Pokemon`.
- Once the minigame is over, `~plclear` is used to clear the player list.

### Common Twists

- Turbo Mode  
- Instead of two players facing off, multiple players from each team will battle at the same time!
- Inverse Version  
- Answering a question correctly eliminates a member of the winners team. The first team to eliminate all of its members wins!
- Tournament Version  
- Players are divided into four teams instead of two. Teams will play in semifinal matches, before the two winning teams face off in finals.
