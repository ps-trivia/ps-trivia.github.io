### Procedure

- This game is freejoin.
- A scorecap is announced by the host before the game starts; players need to reach the scorecap to win.
- Each round begins with the host asking a question.
- Every question answered correctly earns the player one point.
- Furthermore, if a player answers a question correctly and is not already king, they become king of the hill. This earns them 1/3 of a point.
- Players lose their status as king if a different player answers a question correctly.
- The player to first reach the scorecap wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Points can be added or removed with `~addpoints [user], [amount]`, and the leaderboard can be checked with `~showpoints`.
- After the minigame, points are cleared with `~clearpoints`.
