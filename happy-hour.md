### Procedure

- the host announces that a Happy Hour will be happening and gives the condition on questions for the event (it's a good idea to set up a repeating /wall that shows the topic)
- Trivia Tracker proceeds as normal
- during the event, the host tracks how many questions following the condition are asked by each user
- when the event is over, the host displays the scores, announces the winners, and adds each player's score to their TTL score

No commands other than the normal Trivia Tracker ones required to play!

When the game is over, use ``~ttl add, [user], [points]`` to give out bonus points.

# Sad Hour #

This is played in the same way as Happy Hour, but the condition on questions is not announced at the start. Players will be told if their question follows the condition, but not what it is.

Players can guess the condition (in PMs to the host) one time for every question that is asked. If they guess correctly, they earn 10 bonus points.
