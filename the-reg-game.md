# The Reg Game #

[Created by Annika0 and the regs who participated in Minigame Month March 2019](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yU4jdU37wgs3kxYCcZ2dg3ESgR31-Olt43kpZq7Bqb4/edit)

### Procedure

- Users can join the game during signups by typing `/me in` in chat.
- The host sets the number of players who will answer each question.
- At the beginning of each round, 3 random players are selected.
- These players vote for a category, and the host randomly picks a vote.
- The host asks a question in the category. Only the 3 selected players may answer, and the first to answer correctly gains one point.
- This continues until one player reaches a set number of points. This player wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Signups are started with `~plmax [desired number of players]`.
- A player can be added manually with `~pladd [user]` and removed with `~plremove [user]`.
- The player order can be shuffled using `~plshuffle`.
- All remaining players can be seen using `~pl` or `~pllist`.
- A random vote can be selected using `!pick [vote1], [vote2], [vote3]`.
- Once the minigame is over, `~plclear` is used to clear the player list.
