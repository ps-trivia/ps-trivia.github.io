# Mastermind #

Created by shadowsirens

Based on the British game show of the same name, Mastermind is a unique minigame that uses Trivia's Officials format. The goal is to answer as many questions as possible within limited time!

### Procedure

- There are two rounds, the preliminaries and the finals. The minigame begins in the preliminaries, in which players must join. Players are able to join until the final player takes part in the preliminaries.
- Upon joining, players PM the host the category they would like to play in, choosing between Arts & Entertainment (AE), Pokemon (Poke), Science & Geography (SG), and Society & Humanities (SH).
- Each player takes turns participating in a fast-paced Trivia game, in which every question is in their chosen category. The question will only change if the player answers it correctly or passes.
- Players get five points per correct answer in these games, and only they can answer the questions.
- Each round has a time limit.
- The top x players, with x being chosen by the host upon commencing signups, will proceed to the finals.
- In the finals, each player is allowed to answer, but only the first person to guess the correct answer gets the points. Each question in the finals is from a random category, so you cannot rely on your chosen category!


### Commands
