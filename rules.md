# Trivia Rules

Global rules apply.

### General Rules

Users who try to make trouble by using the gray areas of these rules or try to find loopholes in being a bad presence will still be disciplined. <u>This is up to moderator interpretation, so do not try borderline rule-breaking and expect not to be stopped. This also means that you are not entitled to a warning, as it is up to moderator discretion.</u>
- Please do not abuse any formatting (**bold**, *italics*, CAPS, <u>underline</u>, ~~strikethrough~~, spoiler, etc).
- Spam of ANY kind, including but not limited to: stretching, bots, posting of logs on more than one line, or anything that resembles a blatant attempt to spam will not be tolerated.
- Insulting other users, racism, or otherwise offensive behavior is obviously not allowed.
- Evading mutes will result in a roomban or global lock.
- Minor offenses such as overuse of swearing, disrespecting authority (including but not limited to questioning authority in the chat), etc. will also be dealt with.
- Please do not discuss moderator decisions in the chat. If you disagree with a moderator decision then appeal to a room owner (#).
- Do not excessively complain about how the room is being run (i.e. do not complain about the type of question, whoâ€™s asking it, what the rules are, etc.).
- Please don't leak answers to official questions in the chat. Use the `/ta` command to answer questions.
- Do not post links in the chat without permission from staff (% or up). You will be warned and the link will be broken. We will be lenient if the purpose of the link is to clarify a question or appeal a veto, but if told to move on, you must move on.
- If a player willingly and clearly displays the behavior that they qualified for a minigame finals without the intent to participate in them, they will be penalized. These penalties include but may not be limited to: Disqualification from the next minigame, disqualifications from all minigames, or more severe room punishments for repeated behavior.
- Suicide jokes, be it about suicide, related to suicide, or making light of suicide, are disallowed in Trivia. This includes "kms".

### Ranks of Users in Trivia

- **Room Voices (+)**: Room Voices are users who are recognized as overall good chat presences and are good contributors to the room.  Voices are able to use broadcast commands, enforce Trivia Tracker rules, can start trivia games, and can also talk during modchat.
- **Room Drivers (%)**: Room Drivers are users who are responsible for maintaining the room and keeping it under control, resorting to disciplinary actions if necessary. Room drivers are able to warn, 7 minute mute, and hourmute offensive users, as well as all of the above. 
- **Room Moderators (@)**: Room Moderators can do all of the above, but they can also roomban and set modchat. Room Moderators also have the ability to promote a user to room voice, but ONLY after discussing this and gaining approval from the rest of room staff.
- **Room Owners (#)**:  Room Owners are in total charge of the room, and can perform all of the actions that a Room Voice, Room Driver and a Room Moderator can. They can promote users up to room moderator and make declarations in the chat.

Note: Room owners reserve the right to promote users who are already established as trusted and respected users in the Smogon/PS! community.
