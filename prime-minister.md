### Procedure

- The first round is freejoin.
- The host begins by asking a question in chat, and immediately setting a timer. Players will then have to PM the host the correct answer.
- Players only get one try per question; if you have already given an answer, you are not allowed to change it.
- Every player who gets the first question correct is added to the player list.
- Subsequent rounds consist of the host asking a question, and users who remain on the player list PMing an answer to the host within the time limit.
- Every player who fails to answer the question is eliminated, if all players survive, the last player to send the answer is eliminated.
- The last player standing wins the minigame!

### Commands

- A player can be added manually with `~pladd [user]` and can be eliminated with `~plremove [user]`
- All remaining players can be displayed using `~pl` or `~pllist`.
- To set a timer, use `~timer ,[seconds]`.
- Holding shift and pressing enter allows multiple lines to be typed at once, allowing for timer to be set immediately after the question is given.
- Showing PMs in chat is highly recommended to check which players survive and which die.
- Once the minigame is over, `~plclear` is used to clear the player list.

*(Notice the timestamps. Prankin responded in 19 seconds, when the timer was 10 seconds. Since Prankin failed to answer correctly, PokemonDeadChannel is not eliminated despite being the last to answer.)*
