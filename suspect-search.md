[Created by Bunguin87](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13QLpVQYRVEUg0LCv8c38ewPB3PEi3naUbzdBgOHktuQ/edit)

### Procedure

- The game is freejoin.
- The host comes up with a suspect (a historical figure, artist, well-known fictional character, Pokemon character, etc) and writes some questions pertaining to the character. 
- The hosts asks these questions, and a player earns one point for successfully answering the question.
- At any point in time after the question, players can use `~guess [suspect]` in chat to guess the suspect.
- If the player guesses the suspect successfully, they earn 5 points. Otherwise, they lose 2 points.
- The round ends once the suspect is succesfully guessed. The host then starts a new round with a new suspect.
- Once a specified scorecap is reached, or all suspects have been used, the game ends.
- The player with the most points wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Points can be added or removed with `~addpoints [user], [amount]`, and the leaderboard can be checked with `~showpoints`.
- After the minigame, points are cleared with `~clearpoints`.
