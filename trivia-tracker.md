### What is Trivia Tracker?
Trivia Tracker (TT) is the main game mode in the Trivia Room. In this game, the user who has the **BP** (short for **B**aton **P**ass) gets to ask a question, and whoever gets that question right receives the BP and gets to ask their own question. And so on! Meanwhile, the room’s resident bot, Jeopard-E, adds points and keeps track of whose turn it is at all times. If you are new to TT, please read [this brief introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dHRz0vSEuF3WwWnqxVZdss9C1dZE37DrmAVqt0HRTEk) to the game, or scroll down to the section titled "Helpful Topics for New Users."

When you've done so, you should also go through the Question Rules listed on this page to familiarise yourself with the types of questions which should not be asked (you can also PM Jeopard-E with the command ``~rules``). Learning to ask suitable questions will enable you to contribute to the positive room environment. Due to the nature of asking and answering questions in a chatroom, Trivia Tracker has a lot of rules that can be confusing at first. Please don’t be discouraged! Everyone makes mistakes, even after they have been in the Trivia Room for a long time. This guide is here to help you, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask staff for help.

A full guide on how Jeopard-E works can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KyGlawfHaKRUZxZGlqQ3RkVlk/view) (you can also PM the bot with the command ``~help``).

### Basic Trivia Tracker Etiquette

- Please do not use **bold text** unless it is your turn and you’re either asking a question, giving a hint, or vetoing your own question.
- Please do not rush people to ask questions. Once you have the BP, you have **<u>five</u>** minutes to ask a question, after which the BP is opened automatically. Jeopard-E will PM you with a reminder if you have not asked after three minutes. If you claimed an open BP (rather than answering a question correctly), you have **<u>three and a half</u>** minutes to ask your question instead of the usual five.
- Please avoid overasking questions. If a question was recently asked in chat (1-2 hours) it can be vetoed for recency. If a question is asked too often over several days or weeks, it can be vetoed for being overasked.
- If you need an extension, highlight an authorized user (+ or up) and they will close the BP for you. But do not time stall.
- Do not claim BP just to open it again.
- If your question has been vetoed, do not try to use ``~yes``. Ask a new question or open the BP.
- If you would like to dispute a veto, please take it up with a staff member in PM. Don’t debate about it at-length in the chat, as this drags down the game.
- If you think a question should be vetoed, don’t say “veto.” Highlight an auth by saying ``~auth`` and they will deal with the problem. You can only veto your own questions.
- Don’t be mean to new users who don’t understand the rules. Direct them to this document and the beginners’ guide.
- Please respect asker’s discretion in choosing an answer, where applicable.
- Room auth have the authority to exercise leniency to new users in the room in regards to some Trivia Tracker rules.
- Questions or answers that set off Pokemon Showdown's or the Trivia room's automatic spoilers are forbidden.
- Sometimes a question will be vetoed if users are spamming answers, even if it's not multiple choice. Questions whose answers are **numbers** can easily fall under this. Additionally, you may be warned or muted for spamming answers.
- It is heavily discouraged to take questions from other trivia sites and sources; please make an effort to create your own questions.
- **Manipulating or attempting to manipulate TTL in any way, including cheating through PMing questions/answers, using alts to farm points, and asking for help in other rooms, is strictly prohibited, and will be punished with a roomban without warning.**

### Helpful Topics for New Users

#### How Do I Ask a Question?

So it’s your turn to ask a question, but you don’t seem to know how to. The first thing you must remember is to **always bold your questions**. Otherwise, it is unclear if you have asked a question or not. Also, the room bot (Jeopard-E) won’t be able to detect that you’ve asked a question. **The way to bold your question is to surround the text with 2 asterisks**. This will ensure any message within the asterisks will be bolded.

![How to ask 1](/assets/images/tt-how-to-ask-1.png)

*One must not put spaces between the asterisks and the question.*

But wait! What has happened? The bold didn’t work properly in the image above. This is because the user has left spaces between the asterisks (\*) and the question. This will result in the bold not working.

![How to ask 2](/assets/images/tt-how-to-ask-2.png)

As you can see, in the image above, the user has successfully bolded their question! Now it is valid and the other users can answer!

**NOTE**: If you don’t bold your question, you have 5 seconds to correct it, or the question will be vetoed. See "What Is A Veto?" for more information on vetoes.

#### What Should I Do When Someone Answers My Question Correctly?

![How to answer 1](/assets/images/tt-how-to-answer-1.png)

You’ve asked your question, made sure to bold it properly, but now a new challenge arises. “What do I do when somebody answers my question?”  you may ask. When somebody answers your question correctly, you use the ``~yes`` command to announce that they’re the winner! In the above image, the question asker would have to do ``~yes Trivia User 2``, because they’re the first person to successfully answer the question.

![How to answer 2](/assets/images/tt-how-to-answer-2.png)

Keep in mind that the ``~yes`` command only works if you spell the user’s name correctly. A good way to ensure that you always get it right is to type the first few letters of their name and press the TAB key to autocomplete!

(Note: If someone gives more answers than asked and all of them are still correct, they still should get the BP. However, should any of those answers be incorrect, then the answerer cannot receive the BP, as the answer then is wrong. See example below.)

![How to answer 3](/assets/images/tt-how-to-answer-3.png)
*Since Trivia User 22 provided an incorrect answer, they do not get the answer. Trivia User 24 has provided 2 correct answers and thus can get BP. However, if either of them just said "Macron", they'd still have gotten it regardless.*

#### I Don't Want to Ask a Question! How Do I Pass My Asker's Privilege to Someone Else?

Sometimes, you will answer a question correctly, but you will not be able to think of a question, or simply will not want to ask. In this case, you will want to open the bp. **BP**, short for **B**aton **P**ass, denotes whose turn it is to ask a question. If it is your turn, and you no longer wish to ask a question, type the command ``~bpopen`` and voilà! It is no longer your turn! (Alternatively, ``~openbp`` works as well!)

![How to openbp 1](/assets/images/tt-how-to-openbp-1.png)

Now that the bp has been opened, another user who wants to ask a question may say “me” or “bp” and take it. It's as simple as that!

![How to openbp 2](/assets/images/tt-how-to-openbp-2.png)

**IMPORTANT**: Do not reopen BP after claiming an Open BP!

#### I ~yes'd the Wrong Person! What Should I Do Now?

Sometimes when asking a question, you may accidentally ``~yes`` the wrong person.

![How to no 1](/assets/images/tt-how-to-no-1.png)

Fear not! Simply alert that user and ask them to type the command ``~tf`` into the chat. This gives the bp back to you. Now, you can ``~yes`` the correct user!

![How to no 2](/assets/images/tt-how-to-no-2.png)

If the person you gave the bp doesn’t respond for any reason, an auth (someone with +, %, @, #, &, or ~ next to their name) can also use ``~no`` to give you the bp back:

![How to no 3](/assets/images/tt-how-to-no-3.png)

#### How Do I Write a Good Question?

Hopefully, this section will give inspiration, or at least help you understand what makes a good question.
Let's start with an example of a good one:

![How to ask good 1](/assets/images/tt-how-to-ask-good-1.png)
(Answer: Member Card)

Look at the first part of the question: "This ... Key Item" tells readers exactly what you're asking for. You want the name of the particular item. This should always be clear, otherwise you'll have a hard time getting people to understand the question. The middle part of the sentence provides context – Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum are the games which your question is asking about. The last part describes the answer. There are many Key Items in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum, so you have to give enough information for readers to single-out the particular Key Item you're asking for.
Here's another example, this time with the question reorganized:

![How to ask good 2](/assets/images/tt-how-to-ask-good-2.png)
(Answer: Plusle)

Notice how the question still identifies what it's asking for ("this Pokemon") and provides context ("In Pokemon Ranger") and information ("Solana's partner"). All good questions identify these three components.

Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

- **You must provide enough information for people to pick a specific answer**. You might think doing this would make a question too easy, but often it just makes things unclear and unfun when you don’t. When in doubt, it's okay to include extra stuff. For instance, if you ask “Which Pokemon is based on a tree?” you will need to provide more information in order to make sure the only answer is, say, Trevenant instead of Phantump, Tropius, etc.

- **What you're asking for should be a concrete object**. If you ask "Why did Wigglytuff like Perfect Apples?" then answers may have varying degrees of correctness. As a general rule, you should be able to definitively say, "That answer is wrong" or "Correct." If you're able to say "Almost, but you have to be more specific," then it means your question is vague and ambiguous. Try to avoid asking "Why...?" or "How...?" questions, and stick to "What...?" "Where...?" and "Who...?" style questions.

- **Know your audience**. If the majority of the chat doesn't know anything about cellular microbiology, don't ask about cellular microbiology. This makes everybody sad, since they don't understand the material enough to answer questions. When in doubt, ask something about Pokemon!

- **Have fun!**

#### What is a Veto? (And why is this Happening to Me?)


Because Trivia Tracker is a game that tracks points, there are rules for which kinds of questions you’re allowed to ask. If your question breaks one of these rules, it’s likely to be **vetoed**, which means that you must either ask a new question or open the BP.

![What is veto](/assets/images/tt-what-is-veto.png)

Don’t worry--being vetoed is normal, and it can happen to anybody! **It is not a punishment**; it simply means that something went wrong and a new question is needed. Reviewing the following examples will help you avoid being vetoed by knowing which kinds of questions run the risk of being nullified.

Many questions are vetoed because they are incorrect, misspelled, or otherwise impossible to understand. For these issues, please refer to the guide above titled **How Do I Write a Good Question?**

Outside of such errors, there are three general reasons for vetoing a question: 1) it is about a **banned topic**, 2) it is a **banned question/answer type**, or 3) it breaks one or more **special clauses**. And sometimes these rules overlap. We will go over each of these in-depth below in the Question Rules section.

#### Auth Discretion

It should be noted that the following rules dictate which questions must be vetoed. However, **users with voice (+) and higher are at liberty to veto any question they deem problematic on an individual basis**. This is to maximize fun and keep the game running smoothly with integrity. In addition, questions that are overasked may be banned by auth on a day-to-day basis. If you disagree with a veto, please notify the appropriate auth and respectfully explain your point of view to them. They may reverse their decision, but are not obligated to. We always strive to make the game fair, and will not veto questions arbitrarily.

#### Misc

If you aren’t sure what topic to ask about, it’s hard to go wrong with asking a Pokémon question! A popular type of Pokémon question is species/category (“This Pokemon is known as the Bright Pokémon”).

Still confused about how to play Trivia, or anything else not covered in this guide? A good idea is to simply lurk in the chat and watch how it’s done. You’ll pick it up quickly--trust us! Have fun!

### Question Rules

#### Banned/Restricted Topics

There are certain topics that cannot be asked about in Trivia for a number of reasons. If you ask about any of the topics below, the question will be vetoed.

##### Restricted Content

For accessibility purposes, any question that requires you to watch a Youtube or Twitch video/stream, or another external source such as a podcast is not allowed.

![Restricted content](/assets/images/tt-restricted-content.png)

##### Pokemon Showdown

Questions about Pokemon Showdown! are not allowed, whenever they are asking about a user, a room, or something exclusive to PS!

![Pokemon showdown](/assets/images/tt-pokemon-showdown.png)

##### Fan-made Content and ROM Hacks

Fan-made content, including unauthorised derivative content of original works (e.g. Rom Hacks, fanfiction) and community-created content are not allowed in Trivia, unless it has a large and official presence that supersedes it simply being a derivative work. This doesn't include translations of content with no official translations (e.g. Mother 3).

![Fan-made content](/assets/images/tt-fan-made.png)

##### Spoilers

Questions with spoilers are only allowed one month after the worldwide release of their respective media. It is up to auth discretion to determine what exactly constitutes a spoiler, but generally this includes plot-sensitive information and any details by which one would reasonably expect to be surprised while consuming the media organically.

![Spoilers](/assets/images/tt-spoilers.png)

##### News/Events

Questions about recent events, such as breaking news and sporting events, cannot be asked until 12 hours after the news has broken or the event has occurred.

##### Not Trivia

The topic of your question must have trivial significance, and cannot depend only on memes.

![Not trivia](/assets/images/tt-not-trivia.png)

##### Reworded Dex Entries (RDE)

RDEs (reworded dex entries) are questions that ask for a Pokemon based on partially rephrased or reordered information from its dex entry. These questions are allowed as long as they feature a recognizable phrase from the original entry, mention that the content comes from the Pokedex, and are not reworded to the point where they become puzzles or treasure hunts. This will be determined by auth discretion.

![RDE 1](/assets/images/tt-rde-1.png)
Minor changes to the dex entry make this question substantially more difficult, and it is unclear without knowing the answer how many artistic liberties the author has taken with the reword.

![RDE 2](/assets/images/tt-rde-2.png)
This question, however, is legal, as it contains a directly-quoted, recognizable phrase from the entry.

##### Question From Other Showdown Rooms

Do not ask questions which are a current or recent discussion topic in another room on the website. This includes reusing questions which are from an ongoing or recently concluded hunt in the [Scavengers](http://play.pokemonshowdown.com/scavengers) room.

##### Inappropriate/Explicit Content

This should be self-explanatory and in line with global PS rules. If you have any doubts about it, don’t ask the question.

#### Banned/Restricted Question Types

These types of questions are also banned:

##### Unverifiable Answers

This includes subjective questions, fan speculation/unconfirmed rumors, and questions with varying degrees of correctness. There must be an objective, non-negotiable, undebatable answer to your question.

![Unverifiable 1](/assets/images/tt-unverifiable-1.png)
Notice the word “allegedly” in the question. That’s a tip that this question is not verifiable.

![Unverifiable 2](/assets/images/tt-unverifiable-2.png)
GameFreak does not officially define the colors of shinies, and people’s descriptions of colors can vary.

##### Puzzle-type Questions

This includes codes, riddles, and other question types that do not count as trivia. Anagrams are allowed as long as the words have a relationship aside from just being anagrams.

![Puzzle-type](/assets/images/tt-puzzle-type.png)

##### Trick Questions

In Trivia Tracker, asking a question implies that it has a working answer. If the question is asking for a number, an answer of 'zero' is valid and does not necessarily make the question a trick question. Additionally, any answer that requires a question to be interpreted as a trick question is not valid.

![Trick questions](/assets/images/tt-trick-questions.png)
This is a trick question, because the answer is “nobody yet.”

##### Multiple Questions in One

When you have the BP, you get to ask one question, and one question only. These can easily be fixed by simply picking one of the questions to ask, and saving the other for another time. However, specifications ("include the trainer of a Pokemon", "include the country of a city", etc.) are allowed.

![Multiple questions](/assets/images/tt-multiple-questions.png)
This veto could have been avoided by asking only one of these questions.

##### Multiple Choice

Sometimes called **MC**. These are questions where there is a very restricted number of answers and all of them are well-known, such that someone could easily spam-guess until they won. This includes **true or false** and **yes or no** questions.

![Multiple choice](/assets/images/tt-multiple-choice.png)

##### Calculations and Translations

All questions that require calculation (simple or complex) or translation from or into a non-English language are not allowed. A notable exception to this is Pokemon-related questions where Pokemon, moves, etc. have official names in other languages. 

![Calculations](/assets/images/tt-calculations.png)
![Translations](/assets/images/tt-translations.png)

##### Too Broad

Questions that are too general are not allowed and will be vetoed.

![Too broad](/assets/images/tt-too-broad.png)
This question is far too open-ended to constitute trivia.

##### Explanations

This includes **“why”** and **“how”** questions. These are problematic because their answers can be subjective with varying degrees of correctness, and people can easily get into endless debates over semantics.

![Explanations](/assets/images/tt-explanations.png)

##### /dt, /ds, /ms, /as, and /is Searchable Questions

Answers that can be found easily using the PS! search commands /dt, /ds, /ms, /as, and /isearch are not allowed; however, in the case of /is and /as searchable questions, they will only be vetoed if they can be found by using exact words or phrases from your question. 

![Searchable 1](/assets/images/tt-searchable-1.png)

Additionally, all answers that can be obtained using the links provided by /dt are also not allowed.

![Searchable 2](/assets/images/tt-searchable-2.png)
![Searchable 3](/assets/images/tt-searchable-3.png)

##### Lists of Six or More

Ideally answers should be relatively short to keep them simple and avoid flooding. This problem is easily avoided by asking for fewer items.

#### Special Clauses

Outside of the standard rules for questions, there are also a few special clauses that can result in a question being vetoed:

##### The rule of Three in Five

In an effort to diversify the types of questions asked in Trivia Tracker, **we only allow three out of five questions to share the same topic**. If a question is the fourth on that topic in five questions and an auth member points it out before the question is asked, it will be vetoed.

**NOTE: This does not apply to Pokemon.**

![Three in five](/assets/images/tt-three-in-five.png)
This question is normally acceptable, but it was vetoed because it was the fourth geography question out of five.

##### Obscurity Clause

Topics that aren’t Pokemon-related shouldn’t ask for extreme in-depth detail. Askers should keep in mind which topics currently online users are likely to know something about. **Do not ask questions that are technically “answerable,” but are based on a topic of which only you have in-depth knowledge**. ​Pokemon Showdown hosts users of all ages, and thus your question, even though quite easy in your eyes, may completely bamboozle others.
Topics that are discouraged due to being prone to obscurity include: YouTube videos, twitch streams.

**NOTE: Whether an answer can be Googled has no bearing on whether it is considered obscure.**

![Obscurity](/assets/images/tt-obscurity.png)

##### Chat-killing Clause

If a question sharply cuts chat activity for an inordinate period of time because no user can answer it, it is at risk of being vetoed to keep the chat and questions flowing smoothly. The standard limit is 5 minutes without answer, after which it is up to the discretion of auth.

![Chat-killing](/assets/images/tt-chat-killing.png)
Notice the time stamps; nobody answered for five minutes straight, hence the veto. (Note: Smeargle is not an acceptable answer to this question. You will read why in the next section.)

##### Context Clause

If the context of a question is not Pokemon or immediately apparent, please state it in the question, or it will likely be vetoed.

![Context](/assets/images/tt-context.png)
There is no way to tell which game this question is asking about, therefore it is impossible to answer.

##### Boldfail Clause

A question is only valid if it’s been successfully bolded. If you ask a question, but don’t write it in bold, you have five seconds to correct the bold, or it will be vetoed. Auth may choose not to veto for this if it is the user's first time asking a question in the room. 

![Boldfail](/assets/images/tt-boldfail.png)
As you can see from the time stamps, Trivia User failed to fix the bold within 5 seconds.

##### Smogon Clause

Smogon questions are allowed to be asked in Trivia Tracker, but there are a few things you should keep in mind when asking them:

- Questions that can be answered by using /tier and /om are vetoable only if the answer can be accessed by viewing Banlist/Ruleset; this does NOT apply to if the question can be answered by viewing any links about Metagame discussion, Viability rankings, etc.
- OMs such as April Fools' Day modes, Weedmons, etc. fall under meme clause and will be vetoed.
- Questions about analyses will be ruled as obscure at an auth's discretion.

Because Smogon questions are allowed, questions about the Create-A-Pokemon (CAP) project are also allowed by extension. However, CAP-exclusive Pokemon, moves, items, and abilities are never considered valid answers to Pokemon questions unless specified otherwise.

### Rules/Clauses for Accepting Answers

In addition to the regular rules for asking questions, there are also some clauses that dictate whether or not an answer can be accepted. In some cases, a rule means you must accept a certain answer, or an authorized user may reverse the decision. These can be divided into **Pokemon-Related Clauses** and **Other Question Clauses**.

#### Pokemon-related Clauses

**Unless specifically stated otherwise in the question**, these clauses apply to all Pokemon questions.

##### Illegitimacy Clause

Unless stated otherwise in the question, answers involving the use of glitches/hacks are not valid.

![Illigitimacy](/assets/images/tt-illegitimacy.png)
Missingno is technically correct, but it is not an acceptable answer since it is obtained through glitches.

Answers that are unreleased are also counted as illegitimate until they are released in a main series game. The only exceptions to this are Meltan and Melmetal.

##### Smeargle Clause

For the purposes of Trivia Tracker, Smeargle can only learn Sketch and specific event moves that it learns without using Sketch.

![Smeargle 1](/assets/images/tt-smeargle-1.png)
Smeargle is not a viable answer as it can only learn Burn-Up by using Sketch.

![Smeargle 2](/assets/images/tt-smeargle-2.png)
Smeargle is a viable answer here because it can learn Spore through an event.

##### Ambiguous Type Clause

Pokemon and moves that can be multiple types are counted as their default type unless specifically stated otherwise in the question. For example, Arceus and Silvally are considered Normal-type, Revelation Dance and Hidden Power are considered Normal-type, and so on.

![Ambiguous type](/assets/images/tt-ambiguous-type.png)
Arceus is not counted as a Fairy-type.

##### Main Series Clause

All questions about Pokemon games are in the context of the main series games. If the answer to your question comes from a side game and could apply to main series mechanics/characters, you must mention which side game you're referring to in your question. Pokemon Let's Go and Pokemon Legends: Arceus are main series games.

Furthermore, all questions will assume the National Dex, which includes new Pokemon introduced in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Therefore, Ursaring would be NFE and Eviolite would be treated as if it works on Ursaring. Asking about moves introduced in Pokemon Legends: Arceus without specifying the context of Pokemon Legends: Arceus would also be allowed. However, all mechanics, such as battle mechanics, item mechanics, move mechanics, etc. would default to the context of the current VGC game, which would currently be Pokemon Sword and Shield.

![Main series](/assets/images/tt-main-series.png)
Skyridge Machamp has the ability Immunity in the TCG, but Zangoose counts because of Main Series Clause.

##### Recency Clause

All Pokemon questions are in the context of the most recently released game(s), unless otherwise noted in the question.

![Recency](/assets/images/tt-recency.png)
Regardless of the asker’s intentions, the question must go to Trivia User 2, due to Recency Clause.

##### English Anime Clause

All questions are in the context of the English version of the Pokemon anime, which airs after the Japanese anime, unless otherwise specified.

![English anime](/assets/images/tt-english-anime.png)
Charizard would be correct if Trivia Asker specified the Japanese intro.

##### Fan Term Clause

Well known fan terms will be acceptable for question askers to use when asking questions and are allowed to use discretion on whether to accept fan term answers or not. [This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQGorhKGgpWdBi5A0Pb2a-LfVPKXeM-mg4kRfq0F6ao/edit) provides a non-exhaustive list of valid fan terms.

![Fan term 1](/assets/images/tt-fan-term-1.png)
Askers, however, are not allowed to ask questions where only a fan term can be the answer.

![Fan term 2](/assets/images/tt-fan-term-2.png)

##### Normal Battle Conditions

Every question concerning Pokemon battles assumes normal battle conditions (NBC), where the special effects of moves, items, field conditions, etc are disregarded. Abilities of Pokemon that are either explicitly mentioned in the question or the subject of the question are included in NBC. Effects of moves and items can be included if they are explicitly mentioned in the question, or are the subject of the question.

For example Eelektross would be a valid answer to the question **This monotype Pokemon is immune to Ground-type attacks**. This is because Eelektross is the subject of the question so it is assumed to have its ability under normal conditions. Although Thousand Arrows is a Ground-type attack that hits Eelektross, that is a special effect of a move not explicitly mentioned in the question so it is ignored.

Due to its broad nature, Trivia room auth reserves the right to deem anything as normal or not normal battle condition on a case-by-case basis.

##### Z-Moves and Max Moves

All Z-Moves, Max Moves, and G-Max Moves as answers are excluded unless specifically included by the question.

#### Other Answer Clauses

##### Spelling Clause

When answering questions, there is a typo allowance depending on the length of the answer. If your answer falls within this allowance, it must be accepted by the asker. The allowances are:

- Less than 5 letters: zero typos
- Exactly 5 letters: one typo
- More than 5 letters: two typos

Single typos are the following:

- Adding one character (Chna -> China)
- Removing one character (Chinma -> China)
- Changing one character (Chjna -> China)
- Swapping two adjacent characters (Cihna -> China)

The total number of typos in your answer is the fewest number of the above steps needed to change it into the correct answer.

![Spelling 1](/assets/images/tt-spelling-1.png)
“Wrasaw” is one typo away from Warsaw. Therefore, Trivia User 2 gets BP.

**NOTE: There are exceptions--particularly if the answer that’s one/two letters off would constitute a properly-spelt, different answer by itself.**

![Spelling 2](/assets/images/tt-spelling-2.png)
Despite only being one letter off, Woobat is a separate incorrect answer from Swoobat; therefore, Trivia User 2 is correct.

##### One Line Clause

Multiple answers to questions must ​be on one line in order for your answers to count. This is to prevent flooding/spamming in chat.

![One line](/assets/images/tt-one-line.png)

##### Name Clause

If you want the full name of the person you’re asking for in your question you must specify when asking your question otherwise just answering with a last name is acceptable. Questions asking for a full name can be answered with just a first and last name correctly unless the person is known by one or more middle names or initials as well. If an asker is specifically looking for an answer that includes middle names, an alternate name, or prefixes/suffixes, they must specify this in the question ahead of time.

![Name 1](/assets/images/tt-name-1.png)
There is one US President with the last name Lincoln; therefore, Trivia Asker must accept “Lincoln.”

**NOTE: There are exceptions to this--particularly if someone is known primarily by their first name, or if there are two people with the same last name who are famous for the same thing.**
![Name 2](/assets/images/tt-name-2.png)
The asker may use discretion and only accept “FDR” or “Franklin Roosevelt,” because of President Theodore Roosevelt.

### Glossary of Pokemon Term Definitions

#### Category Name

A Pokemon’s **category name** (or just **category**) is a piece of in-game information that appears in its Pokedex entry. Since Wynaut is the “Bright Pokemon,” its category is “Bright.” This used to be called species, which now simply refers to the name of the Pokemon (Wynaut’s species is “Wynaut.”).

#### Forms

**Forms** (sometimes written as **formes**) are major variations of Pokemon in the main series games that change the Pokemon's appearance and/or in-battle characteristics.The two categories of forms are functional and cosmetic. The former has notable in-battle differences, while the latter is only a change of appearance. Non-base forms are considered viable answers for questions in which the base form is also correct. You do not need to specify a modifier for base forms, such as Shaymin-Land. Some Pokemon do not have base forms, so you must answer with the full form name (for example, Oricorio does not have a base form.). All recognized Pokemon forms can be found using [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/158AfuH9Abr0gOLDplc3cf2WPQwUsc57OjHO3My52WUo/edit#gid=0).

#### Functional Forms

A functional form is a major variation of Pokemon in which its in-battle characteristics are altered. These characteristics can include its Base Stat distribution, moveset, and typing; they have a recognizable difference with other forms outside of appearance.

#### Cosmetic Forms

A cosmetic form is a major variation of Pokemon in which its appearance is altered, without any in-battle consequences.  Other main series minor variations (such as shinies or Spinda patterns) or variations in side games (such as Shadow Pokemon or Magikarp patterns) are not forms. 

#### Fossil Pokemon

A Fossil Pokemon is any Pokemon or evolution of a Pokemon which can be revived from a fossil. The following Pokemon are defined as Fossil Pokemon:
Omanyte, Omastar, Kabuto, Kabutops, Aerodactyl, Anorith, Armaldo, Lileep, Cradily, Shieldon, Bastiodon, Cranidos, Rampardos, Tirtouga, Carracosta, Archen, Archeops, Tyrunt, Tyrantrum, Amaura, Aurorus, Dracozolt, Arctozolt, Dracovish, Arctovish

#### Little Cup (LC)

A Little Cup or LC Pokemon is a Pokemon that does not evolve from anything and is still capable of evolving. This is not the same as the LC competitive tier, in which certain Pokemon that would be characterized as LC for the purposes of Trivia are banned (such as Yanma and Poipole). This is also a subset of not fully evolved (NFE).

#### Not Fully Evolved (NFE)

A **not fully evolved** or **NFE** Pokemon is any Pokemon that is still capable of evolving, whether or not it evolved from anything else. By this definition, both Bulbasaur and Ivysaur are NFE, though Bulbasaur is also LC.

#### Fully Evolved

A fully evolved Pokemon is a Pokemon that cannot evolve any further. It is at its highest evolutionary stage. By this definition, Skarmory (for example) is fully evolved. If you want to exclude Pokemon that haven’t evolved from anything, you must state this. For example: “This is the Fairy-type Pokemon with the highest BST that is fully evolved and has at least one previous evolution.” Note that a Pokemon like Venusaur is still considered to be fully-evolved, even if it is still capable of mega-evolving.

#### Pseudo-Legendary

For the purposes of Trivia Tracker, the term **pseudo-legendary** or **pseudo-legend** is understood to refer to the following Pokemon (but not their pre-evolutions):
Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamence, Metagross, Garchomp, Hydreigon, Goodra, Kommo-o, Dragapult, Baxcalibur

#### Legendary and Mythical Pokemon

The following Pokemon are defined as **legendary** for the purposes of trivia (italicized are also **mythical**):
Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo, Raikou, Entei, Suicune, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Latias, Latios, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Dialga, Palkia, Heatran, Regigigas, Giratina, Cresselia, Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion, Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, Kyurem, Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, Type: Null, Silvally, Cosmog, Cosmoem, Solgaleo, Lunala, Necrozma, Zacian, Zamazenta, Eternatus, Kubfu, Urshifu, Regieleki, Regidrago, Glastrier, Spectrier, Calyrex, Enamorus, Koraidon, Miraidon, Chien-Pao, Chi-Yu, Ting-Lu, Wo-Chien, *Mew*, *Celebi*, *Jirachi*, *Deoxys*, *Manaphy*, *Phione*, *Darkrai*, *Shaymin*, *Arceus*, *Victini*, *Keldeo*, *Meloetta*, *Genesect*, *Diancie*, *Hoopa*, *Volcanion*, *Magearna*, *Marshadow*, *Zeraora*, *Meltan*, *Melmetal*, *Zarude*

#### Starter Pokemon

A **starter** in the context of the games is a Pokemon bestowed on the player character at the beginning of a game. Owing to main series clause, any question asking about “starters,” unless otherwise specified, will be interpreted as describing the following Pokemon and their evolutions, all forms excluded:
Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu*, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Piplup, Chimchar, Turtwig, Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie, Rowlet, Litten, Popplio, Grookey, Scorbunny, Sobble, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly

*Raichu is not a starter because the Pikachu you receive as a starter cannot evolve into Raichu.

#### Signature, unique, and exclusive moves

For the purposes of Trivia, unique is a move only learned by one Pokemon; Dragon Darts is *unique* to Dragapult. **Signature** is a move only learned by one evolutionary line; Barrage is *signature* to the Exeggcute line. **Exclusive** is a move only learned by a specific group of Pokemon. A move is never exclusive on its own, but is always exclusive to a group; Fishious Rend is not '*exclusive*', but it is "*exclusive to Fossil Pokemon*" (note that all this applies to abilities, items, and typings as well).

#### Immunity

An **immunity** or **type immunity** is the capability of a Pokemon to take no damage from moves of a specific type. For the purposes of Trivia, this term does not include other immunities such as ones to specific weather or status conditions, unless stated otherwise.
