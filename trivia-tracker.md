### What is Trivia Tracker?
Trivia Tracker (TT) is the main game mode in the Trivia Room. In this game, the user who has the **BP** (short for **B**aton **P**ass) gets to ask a question, and whoever gets that question right receives the BP and gets to ask their own question. And so on! Meanwhile, the room’s resident bot, Jeopard-E, adds points and keeps track of whose turn it is at all times. If you are new to TT, please read [this brief introduction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dHRz0vSEuF3WwWnqxVZdss9C1dZE37DrmAVqt0HRTEk) to the game, or scroll down to the section titled "Helpful Topics for New Users."

When you've done so, you should also go through the Question Rules listed on this page to familiarise yourself with the types of questions which should not be asked (you can also PM Jeopard-E with the command ``~rules``). Learning to ask suitable questions will enable you to contribute to the positive room environment. Due to the nature of asking and answering questions in a chatroom, Trivia Tracker has a lot of rules that can be confusing at first. Please don’t be discouraged! Everyone makes mistakes, even after they have been in the Trivia Room for a long time. This guide is here to help you, and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask staff for help.

A full guide on how Jeopard-E works can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8KyGlawfHaKRUZxZGlqQ3RkVlk/view) (you can also PM the bot with the command ``~help``).

### Basic Trivia Tracker Etiquette

- Please do not use **bold text** unless it is your turn and you’re either asking a question, giving a hint, or vetoing your own question.
- Please do not rush people to ask questions. Once you have the BP, you have <u>**five**</u> minutes to ask a question, after which the BP is opened automatically. Jeopard-E will PM you with a reminder if you have not asked after three minutes. If you claimed an open BP (rather than answering a question correctly), you have <u>**three and a half**</u> minutes to ask your question instead of the usual five.
- Please avoid overasking questions. If a question was recently asked in chat (1-2 hours) it can be vetoed for recency. If a question is asked too often over several days or weeks, it can be vetoed for being overasked.
- If you need an extension, highlight an authorized user (+ or up) and they will close the BP for you. But do not time stall.
- Do not claim BP just to open it again.
- If your question has been vetoed, do not try to use ``~yes``. Ask a new question or open the BP.
- If you would like to dispute a veto, please take it up with a staff member in PM. Don’t debate about it at-length in the chat, as this drags down the game.
- If you think a question should be vetoed, don’t say “veto.” Highlight an auth by saying ``~auth`` and they will deal with the problem. You can only veto your own questions.
- Don’t be mean to new users who don’t understand the rules. Direct them to this document and the beginners’ guide.
- Please respect asker’s discretion in choosing an answer, where applicable.
- Room auth have the authority to exercise leniency to new users in the room in regards to some Trivia Tracker rules.
- Questions or answers that set off Pokemon Showdown's or the Trivia room's automatic spoilers are forbidden.
- Sometimes a question will be vetoed if users are spamming answers, even if it's not multiple choice. Questions whose answers are **numbers** can easily fall under this. Additionally, you may be warned or muted for spamming answers.
- It is heavily discouraged to take questions from other trivia sites and sources; please make an effort to create your own questions.
- **Manipulating or attempting to manipulate TTL in any way, including cheating through PMing questions/answers, using alts to farm points, and asking for help in other rooms, is strictly prohibited, and will be punished with a roomban without warning.**

### Glossary of Pokemon Term Definitions

#### Category Name

A Pokemon’s **category name** (or just **category**) is a piece of in-game information that appears in its Pokedex entry. Since Wynaut is the “Bright Pokemon,” its category is “Bright.” This used to be called species, which now simply refers to the name of the Pokemon (Wynaut’s species is “Wynaut.”).

#### Forms

**Forms** (sometimes written as **formes**) are major variations of Pokemon in the main series games that change the Pokemon's appearance and/or in-battle characteristics.The two categories of forms are functional and cosmetic. The former has notable in-battle differences, while the latter is only a change of appearance. Non-base forms are considered viable answers for questions in which the base form is also correct. You do not need to specify a modifier for base forms, such as Shaymin-Land. Some Pokemon do not have base forms, so you must answer with the full form name (for example, Oricorio does not have a base form.). All recognized Pokemon forms can be found using [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/158AfuH9Abr0gOLDplc3cf2WPQwUsc57OjHO3My52WUo/edit#gid=0).

#### Functional Forms

A functional form is a major variation of Pokemon in which its in-battle characteristics are altered. These characteristics can include its Base Stat distribution, moveset, and typing; they have a recognizable difference with other forms outside of appearance.

#### Cosmetic Forms

A cosmetic form is a major variation of Pokemon in which its appearance is altered, without any in-battle consequences.  Other main series minor variations (such as shinies or Spinda patterns) or variations in side games (such as Shadow Pokemon or Magikarp patterns) are not forms. 

#### Fossil Pokemon

A Fossil Pokemon is any Pokemon or evolution of a Pokemon which can be revived from a fossil. The following Pokemon are defined as Fossil Pokemon:
Omanyte, Omastar, Kabuto, Kabutops, Aerodactyl, Anorith, Armaldo, Lileep, Cradily, Shieldon, Bastiodon, Cranidos, Rampardos, Tirtouga, Carracosta, Archen, Archeops, Tyrunt, Tyrantrum, Amaura, Aurorus, Dracozolt, Arctozolt, Dracovish, Arctovish

#### Little Cup (LC)

A Little Cup or LC Pokemon is a Pokemon that does not evolve from anything and is still capable of evolving. This is not the same as the LC competitive tier, in which certain Pokemon that would be characterized as LC for the purposes of Trivia are banned (such as Yanma and Poipole). This is also a subset of not fully evolved (NFE).

#### Not Fully Evolved (NFE)

A **not fully evolved** or **NFE** Pokemon is any Pokemon that is still capable of evolving, whether or not it evolved from anything else. By this definition, both Bulbasaur and Ivysaur are NFE, though Bulbasaur is also LC.

#### Fully Evolved

A fully evolved Pokemon is a Pokemon that cannot evolve any further. It is at its highest evolutionary stage. By this definition, Skarmory (for example) is fully evolved. If you want to exclude Pokemon that haven’t evolved from anything, you must state this. For example: “This is the Fairy-type Pokemon with the highest BST that is fully evolved and has at least one previous evolution.” Note that a Pokemon like Venusaur is still considered to be fully-evolved, even if it is still capable of mega-evolving.

#### Pseudo-Legendary

For the purposes of Trivia Tracker, the term **pseudo-legendary** or **pseudo-legend** is understood to refer to the following Pokemon (but not their pre-evolutions):
Dragonite, Tyranitar, Salamence, Metagross, Garchomp, Hydreigon, Goodra, Kommo-o, Dragapult

#### Legendary and Mythical Pokemon

The following Pokemon are defined as **legendary** for the purposes of trivia (italicized are also **mythical**):
Articuno, Zapdos, Moltres, Mewtwo, Raikou, Entei, Suicune, Lugia, Ho-Oh, Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Latias, Latios, Kyogre, Groudon, Rayquaza, Uxie, Mesprit, Azelf, Dialga, Palkia, Heatran, Regigigas, Giratina, Cresselia, Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion, Tornadus, Thundurus, Reshiram, Zekrom, Landorus, Kyurem, Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini, Type: Null, Silvally, Cosmog, Cosmoem, Solgaleo, Lunala, Necrozma, Zacian, Zamazenta, Eternatus, Kubfu, Urshifu, Regieleki, Regidrago, Glastrier, Spectrier, Calyrex, Enamorus, *Mew*, *Celebi*, *Jirachi*, *Deoxys*, *Manaphy*, *Phione*, *Darkrai*, *Shaymin*, *Arceus*, *Victini*, *Keldeo*, *Meloetta*, *Genesect*, *Diancie*, *Hoopa*, *Volcanion*, *Magearna*, *Marshadow*, *Zeraora*, *Meltan*, *Melmetal*, *Zarude*

#### Starter Pokemon

A **starter** in the context of the games is a Pokemon bestowed on the player character at the beginning of a game. Owing to main series clause, any question asking about “starters,” unless otherwise specified, will be interpreted as describing the following Pokemon and their evolutions, all forms excluded:
Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Pikachu*, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Piplup, Chimchar, Turtwig, Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Chespin, Fennekin, Froakie, Rowlet, Litten, Popplio, Pikachu-Starter, Eevee-Starter, Grookey, Scorbunny, Sobble

*Raichu is not a starter because the Pikachu you receive as a starter cannot evolve into Raichu.

#### Signature, unique, and exclusive moves

For the purposes of Trivia, unique is a move only learned by one Pokemon; Dragon Darts is *unique* to Dragapult. **Signature** is a move only learned by one evolutionary line; Barrage is *signature* to the Exeggcute line. **Exclusive** is a move only learned by a specific group of Pokemon. A move is never exclusive on its own, but is always exclusive to a group; Fishious Rend is not '*exclusive*', but it is "*exclusive to Fossil Pokemon*" (note that all this applies to abilities, items, and typings as well).

#### Immunity

An **immunity** or **type immunity** is the capability of a Pokemon to take no damage from moves of a specific type. For the purposes of Trivia, this term does not include other immunities such as ones to specific weather or status conditions, unless stated otherwise.
