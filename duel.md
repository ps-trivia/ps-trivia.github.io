# Duel #

### Procedure

- Users can join the game during signups by typing "/me in" in chat.
- At the beginning of each round, a random player is selected. This player then selects the another player to duel.
- The host asks a question, and the player who answers the question correctly first survives. The other player is eliminated.
- This continues until one player remains. The lone survivor wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Signups are started with "~plmax [desired number of players]". To end the signups, use "~plmax".
- A player can be added manually with "~pladd [user]" and can be eliminated with "~plremove [user]".
- All remaining players can be seen using "~pl" or "~pllist".
- Players can be randomly picked with "~plpick".
- Once the minigame is over, "~plclear" is used to clear the player list.

### Common Twists

- Turbo Mode  
Instead of 1v1s, duels may consist of more players on each side, or more players competing at once.
- Double Lives  
A player must lose two duels to be eliminated.
- Winner Pooling  
Winners are placed in a separate pool, and cannot be chosen again until no more rounds can occur in the original pool.
- Mono Category  
All questions will fall under one category.
- Vicious Verbosity  
The host gives questions with many answers (eg "Name an Electric-type status move"), and the players fight to give the longest answer. If a player gives an answer longer than any previous answers, they take the lead. If they maintain the lead for seven seconds they win the round.

# Team Duel #

- After signups, players are divided into pairs. Players can decide teams among themselves, or teams can be randomly generated by the host.
- Instead of individual players facing off, two teams will duel in each round. All players from both teams can answer, and the first to do so correctly wins the round for their team.
- The game continues until one team remains. The last team standing wins the minigame!

- Trivia auth face off against regs in this variation on duel! Essentially the same game, except for one main difference: all auth must challenge regs and vice versa! The last team remaining wins!
