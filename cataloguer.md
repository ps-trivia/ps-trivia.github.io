[Created by Shadow Sirens](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnWedRSoGCdclj4qkNZwIle7K7st4zFcSwylhxDjiI8/edit?usp=sharing)

### Procedure

- The first round is freejoin.
- The host begins by asking a question in chat with many answers in chat, and immediately set a time limit.
- Players PM the host as many possible answers as they can within the time limit.
- Every player who gives a correct answer to the first question is added to the player list.
- Subsequent rounds consist of the host asking another question with multiple answers, and users who remain on the player list PMing as many answers as they can.
- The player who gives the least correct answers within the time limit is eliminated. If multiple people are in last place then it is up to hosts discretion whether all are eliminated or a tiebreaker is made.
- The last player standing wins the minigame!

### Commands

- A player can be added manually with `~pladd [user]` and can be eliminated with `~plremove [user]`.
- All remaining players can be displayed using `~pl` or `~pllist`.
- To set a timer, use `~timer ,[seconds]`.
- Holding shift and pressing enter allows multiple lines to be typed at once, allowing for timer to be set immediately after the question is given.
- Showing PMs in chat is highly recommended to check which players survive and which die.
- Once the minigame is over, `~plclear` is used to clear the player list.
