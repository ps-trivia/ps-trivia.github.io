### Procedure

- Users can join the game during signups by typing `/me in` in chat.
- At the beginning of each round, the host shuffles the player order.
- The host then asks a question with multiple answers, while a hidden timer is set.
- Players will take turn giving a new answer to the question in the order given. (Once every player has answered the question, the first player answers again.)
- This continues until a player gives a wrong or repeated answer, of if the timer runs out.
- The player on move in this situation is eliminated.
- Another round is then started with a new question and player order.
- This continues until one player remains. The lone survivor wins the minigame!

### Commands

- Signups are started with `~plmax [desired number of players]`.
- A player can be added manually with `~pladd [user]` and can be eliminated with `~plremove [user]`.
- The player order can be shuffled using `~plshuffle`.
- The timer can be set to a random number of seconds by using `~timer ,[minimum seconds]:[maximum seconds],,,trivia` in PMs to Jeopard-E. This way, the randomly selected time will not be visible to the players.
- All remaining players can be seen using `~pl` or `~pllist`.
- Once the minigame is over, `~plclear` is used to clear the player list.
