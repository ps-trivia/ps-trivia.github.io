Trivia Tracker (TT) is the most commonly played game in the Trivia room. In it, users ask each other questions and aim to get to the top of the leaderboard by asking and answering the most questions. To start playing, all you have to do is answer questions in chat.

If you get a question correct, you will get a point and receive BP (meaning it is your turn to ask a question). You will have five minutes to come up with a question to ask, that follows these general guidelines:

- the answer should be short and factual (no long lists or subjective answers)
- the answer should not be easy to find with PS commands (eg ``/dt`` and ``/ds``)
- other players should have a reasonable chance of knowing the answer without looking it up

Our [official question rules](https://pstrivia.weebly.com/trivia-tracker.html) are more complicated than this, but use the simplified guidelines to start out and ask a Trivia auth if your question is valid when in doubt.

When you have come up with a question, ask it by sending it as bold text. This is done by putting **\*\*two asterisks on each side of your question\*\***. Then, when someone says the answer, use the ``~yes`` command to let Jeopard-E know. And there it is, you've asked your first question!

If you don't want to ask a question, you can forfeit your chance to ask (and the points you would gain from asking) by using ``~bpopen`` and others will be allowed to claim the chance to ask. While we prefer asking questions to opening BP, you are never required to ask a question and are always free to open BP.
